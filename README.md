# Artificial Neural Network- Bank Churn Prediction
*"In 2012, 50% of customers, globally, either changed their banks or were planning to change. In US and Canada, customers who changed their banks increased from 38% in 2011 to 45% in 2012.”* – Global Consumer Banking Survey 2012, Ernst & Young.

Customer churn and engagement has become one of the top issues for most of the banks. The cost of acquiring new customers is significantly higher than retaining existing ones and it costs far more to re-acquire deflected customers.

In an era of technology, bad news spreads like fire and most of the customers rely on reviews posted by people in the online platforms for various banking products. So the ability to track customer sentiments can give banks early indicators into customer service, pricing and promotions.

With the help of Big data technologies, banks are now able to store, manange, retrieve and analyse customer data like Credit score, geography, gender, age, number of bank products, active member and customer exited. Hence, by utilizing the immense power of supervised deep learning, churn models can be built which would help banks predict how likely are existing customers to leave the bank.

Based on the predictions, banks can leverage targeted and personalized marketing for the customers highly likely to leave the bank.This would help banks explore the reasons as to why a customer wants to leave and can use this to improve their products and services for future. This would not only save banks billions of dollars but would make them be more customer-centric, which is a true formula for success of their business.
